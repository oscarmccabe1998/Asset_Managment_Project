# Asset Managmennt system

A program I developed for my Software Engineering practices class to scan hardware and software information 
from an asset and keep a record of the information in a database. The system is also able to take in 
information from software assets and check them against the NIST database.

The system was developed using the QT framework. 

I had to re-upload the code as the original repo contained Database credentails and API keys.

Dependencies
- requirements.txt

Usage
- python SystemInfoUiController.py

Logic
- UI logic can be found in SystemInfoUiController.py
- System scan logic can be found in SystemInfo.py
- API logic can be found in apireq.py

Pre hook has been added to check the login system locally before commiting

System can be accessed with the credentials "admin" for the user name and "Password-1" for the password.
Executable has been submitted on mylearningspace along with the paper work and video
